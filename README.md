# Flexi Form

Flexi Form is a SaaS platform that allows users to create dynamic forms using simple descriptions. The forms are generated by the Gemini API and can be customized with various themes, previewed in real-time, and shared via a link. Users can also download form responses in XLSX format. The platform includes a subscription model where new users can create up to three forms for free, after which they must subscribe to continue using the service.
